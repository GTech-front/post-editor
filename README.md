# Post editor

This is a simple post editor utilizing [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) and [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown).
[Here](https://gtech-front.github.io/post-editor/) you can see demo.

## Running locally

To run locally u simply need to:
- Download repo to your machine
- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start`

However we assume that you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en) on your machine - as it's necessary.

## Deploying to gh-pages

To deploy newest changes to gh-pages simply run `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy`. Rest is handled by github.
